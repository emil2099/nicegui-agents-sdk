# Future Improvements for AgentStepper

The following features are present in the static mock-up but cannot yet be fully realized with the current event stream data:

- [ ] **Rich Thought Process**: Capture and display detailed intermediate thoughts (e.g., "Debugging invisible text") instead of just "Thinking...".
- [ ] **Rich Tool Cards**: Parse tool results (especially search results) to display rich cards with titles, icons, and snippets, rather than raw text/JSON.
- [ ] **Citation Metadata**: Extract and display structured citation data (titles, URLs) from tool outputs.

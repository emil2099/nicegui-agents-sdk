## Virtual environment
We are using python virtual environment installed in .venv directory. Make sure to use that prior to running any scripts.

## Overall purpose
- We are trying to learn about agents SDK and how it can work with Nicegui to build fantastic user experiences
- We are doing this as a POC and exploration, so we want to keep things simple and well structured

## Simplicity First
- Prefer simple, straightforward solutions
- Avoid over-engineering
- Remove obsolete code rather than working around it
- Code should be self-explanatory

## Code quality
- The library being designed is foundational to a larger product. As part of POC, it is important to cleanly test core ideas without introducing unnecessary levels of abstraction and complexity. It is instrumental to keep everything as simple and elegant as possible.

## When Uncertain

- **Check online sources** for inspiration or verification rather than guessing
- **Search the codebase** for similar patterns before inventing new ones
- **Ask the user** by presenting options and trade-offs if strategy is unclear
- **Start broad, then narrow**: Explore with semantic search, then drill into specific files
